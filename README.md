# 100 Days of Python Coding Journey

Welcome to my 100 days of Python coding journey! This README serves as a guide to help you navigate through my progress, goals, and projects during this journey.

## Introduction

In this repository, I will be documenting my daily progress as I work through various Python coding challenges, projects, and learning resources. The purpose of this journey is to strengthen my foundations in Python programming and improve my coding skills.

## Goals

My primary goals for this 100-day journey include:

- **Improving Python Proficiency:** Enhance my understanding of Python programming concepts, syntax, and best practices.
- **Building Projects:** Work on practical projects to apply my Python skills and gain hands-on experience.
- **Consistent Learning:** Commit to coding daily and maintain consistency throughout the journey.
- **Community Engagement:** Engage with the coding community, share my progress, and learn from others.

## Progress Tracking

I will be updating my progress daily in this repository. Each day, I will:

- Document the tasks or projects I worked on.
- Share my code solutions and any insights gained.
- Reflect on challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Repository Structure

- **Day_X:** Each day of the journey will have its own folder named "Day_X", where "X" represents the day number.
  - Inside each day's folder:
    - **README.md:** Daily log documenting progress, tasks, and reflections.
    - **Code Files:** Python scripts or notebooks containing code solutions for the day's tasks/projects.

## How to Navigate

- To view my daily progress, simply navigate to the corresponding day's folder.
- Feel free to explore the code files and READMEs to understand my approach and solutions.

## Resources

During this journey, I'll be using various resources to learn and improve my Python skills, including:

- Online tutorials and courses
- Coding challenges and exercises
- Project-based learning
- Books and documentation
