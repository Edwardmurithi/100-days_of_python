# Day 1: Summary of Learning

## What I Learned Today

Today, I focused on getting started with Python programming. Here's a summary of what I learned:

### 1. Input and Output
- I learned how to prompt the user for input using the `input()` function.
- I discovered how to display output to the user using the `print()` function.

### 2. Variables and Data Types
- I learned about variables and how to assign values to them.
- I explored different data types in Python, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

### 3. String Manipulation
- I learned various string manipulation techniques, such as concatenation and formatting.

### 4. Basic Program Structure
- I practiced structuring simple Python programs to accomplish specific tasks.

## Extra Bonus Study

In addition to the core topics mentioned above, I also delved into the following bonus topics:

### 1. String Formatting
- I explored different methods for formatting strings in Python, including f-strings and the `.format()` method.

### 2. Error Handling
- I studied the basics of error handling in Python, including using `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

### 3. Python Documentation
- I familiarized myself with the Python documentation and learned how to look up information about built-in functions and modules.

## Next Steps

For my next session, I plan to build on the foundations established today by exploring more advanced topics such as control flow, functions, and data structures.

Stay tuned for more updates on my Python learning journey!
